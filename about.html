She was involved in the Radio Aurora Explorer (RAX) CubeSat Mission from 2009-2012, where she worked on GPS design analysis and verification and operational scheduling. She completed a Ph.D. in aerospace engineering at the University of Michigan in December 2012. The focus of her doctoral work was on developing a modeling and simulation framework for space systems, and optimization algorithms for scheduling small satellites and heterogeneous ground networks toward enhanced communication capacity. She has been a member of the INCOSE Space Systems Working Group (SSWG) since 2011 and was an intern at NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL) in 2012, where she worked on developing a RAX CubeSat SysML model and integrating diverse simulation environments to enable simulation of diverse mission architectures. She consulted for AGI in the Spring of 2013, focusing on advancing behavior-based MBSE capabilities for operational space missions. She is currently working at NASA's Jet Propulstion Lab (JPL) in the Mission Systems Concepts Section (312B).
