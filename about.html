She is currently a Telecommunication Engineer at NASA JPL (332H). She has developed communication systems for different university missions (CASTOR, ExoplanetSat, TerSat, REXIS, TALARIS). She has been with the Communication Architecture Research Group, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, CA. Her current research interests include communication architecture design, statistical risk estimation, multidisciplinary design optimization, and mission scheduling and planning. She was a member of the organizing committee for iCubeSat 2012 (MIT, Cambridge), and she is a session chair at the IEEE Aerospace Conference.

                            Sara completed a B.Sc. in mechanical engineering at the University of Manitoba and a Master's degree in aerospace engineering at the University of Michigan, focusing on optimizing trajectories for energy-efficient periodic solar-powered UAVs. She was involved in the Radio Aurora Explorer (RAX) CubeSat Mission from 2009-2012, where she worked on GPS design analysis and verification and operational scheduling. She completed a Ph.D. in aerospace engineering at the University of Michigan in December 2012. The focus of her doctoral work was on developing a modeling and simulation framework for space systems, and optimization algorithms for scheduling small satellites and heterogeneous ground networks toward enhanced communication capacity. She has been a member of the INCOSE Space Systems Working Group (SSWG) since 2011 and was an intern at NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL) in 2012, where she worked on developing a RAX CubeSat SysML model and integrating diverse simulation environments to enable simulation of diverse mission architectures. She consulted for AGI in the Spring of 2013, focusing on advancing behavior-based MBSE capabilities for operational space missions. She is currently working at NASA's Jet Propulstion Lab (JPL) in the Mission Systems Concepts Section (312B).
